## 1. Flat File Systems vs. Relational Databases ‚Äì Comparison

| Feature             | Flat File System                                      | Relational Database (RDBMS)                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Structure**       | Simple text files without a defined schema            | Organized into tables with a defined schema          |
| **Data Redundancy** | High ‚Äì duplicate data is common                       | Low ‚Äì data is normalized to reduce repetition        |
| **Relationships**   | No support for data relationships                     | Supports relationships using foreign keys            |
| **Example Usage**   | CSV files, Excel spreadsheets                         | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle                            |
| **Drawbacks**       | Hard to scale, query, or manage                       | Requires setup and has a learning curve              |

## 4. üìÇ Types of Databases

### A. Relational vs. Non-Relational

| Type             | Description                                  | Examples                    |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Relational**    | Structured, table-based, schema-driven       | MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server   |
| **Non-Relational**| Schema-less, supports unstructured data      | MongoDB, Cassandra          |

### B. Centralized vs. Distributed vs. Cloud

| Type          | Description                                        | Use Case Example                 |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Centralized**| Single location stores all data                   | Local inventory system           |
| **Distributed**| Data stored across multiple systems               | Global platforms like Netflix    |
| **Cloud**      | Cloud-hosted and managed infrastructure           | Amazon RDS for e-commerce apps   |

## 5. ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Storage and Databases

### What is Cloud Storage?
Cloud storage refers to saving data on remote servers accessed through the internet, often managed by third-party providers like **AWS**, **Azure**, or **Google Cloud**.

### How It Supports Databases:
- Automatically scalable storage
- Easy integration with managed DB services
- Enables global data access and real-time backups

### ‚úÖ Advantages:
- Auto-scaling
- Lower startup costs
- No physical infrastructure required
- Built-in high availability and disaster recovery

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges:
- Requires internet connection
- Possible data breach risks if unsecured
- Cost increases with usage
- May have legal/compliance limitations
